If you know of an elegant solution, \r\nwithout adding to the controller, but allowing for multiple relations in a view, let me know.  \r\n\r\nAnother way of handling this is seeing: [http://book.mixu.net/ch7.html](http://book.mixu.net/ch7.html), particularly section\r\n7.2.1 Control flow pattern #1: Series. Mikito Takada has some really insightful documentation on the asynchronous nature of\r\nNode, and how we might solve this problem (or work nicely with this feature :-)).  \r\n\r\n*Update*: See method `getAssociated` the *application_controller* for a useful way or handling associations. \r\nAgain, if you know of a more elegant solution, let me know.  \r\n\r\n##Components\r\n\r\n* [Compound.JS](http://compoundjs.com/) (formally known as Railway) is built on the [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) framework.\r\n* Templates are using [ejs](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs).\r\n* ORM is [Juggling DB](https://github.com/1602/jugglingdb).\r\n* This example is using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) throughout, but not through a plugin.\r\n\r\n##Models\r\n\r\n(Currently):\r\n\r\n* __Posts__: { BelongsTo: [ Users ], HasMany: [ Comments ] }\r\n* __Comments__: { BelongsTo: [ Posts, Users ] }\r\n* __Users__: { HasMany: [ Comments, Posts ], HABTM: [ Roles (through Memberships) ] }\r\n* __Roles__: { HABTM: [ Users (through Memberships) ]}\r\n* __Memberships__: { BelongsTo: [ Posts, Roles ] }\r\n\r\nMaybe more to come, including __Photos__, see [Picsee](https://github.com/dlochrie/picsee).\r\n\r\n##ACL - Authorization\r\n\r\nACL (Access Control List) is managed by a JSON file, should you provide it. \r\nRight now, ACL is configured by a JSON file, and not through a DB Resource, but\r\nthat feature could come in time.\r\n\r\nThe format for your ACL file looks like:\r\n\r\n    env\r\n      settings\r\n        cachedRoles\r\n        cachedAbilities\r\n      roles\r\n        key\r\n          displayName\r\n          description\r\n          abilities\r\n\r\nAnd the JSON example:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"development\": {\r\n        \"settings\": {\r\n          \"cacheRoles\": \"true\",\r\n          \"cacheAbilities\": \"true\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"roles\": {\r\n          \"admin\": {\r\n            \"displayName\": \"Admin\",\r\n            \"description\": \"Admins can do anything\",\r\n            \"abilities\": [{\r\n              \"controller\": \"posts\",\r\n              \"actions\": [\r\n                \"create\",\r\n                \"update\",\r\n                \"delete\"\r\n              ]\r\n            }]\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAuthorization is determined by a User's Abilities. Abilities are a combination\r\nof a `controller` and `actions` on that controller. The wildcard `*` adds all\r\nactions that a controller has. Note, actions do not necessarily equal access to \r\na _page_, but to that _action_, which makes authorization useful for RESTful \r\nrequests as well.\r\n\r\nYou can provide as many Roles as you want, and each Role can have multiple\r\nabilities. If a User has multiple Roles with overlapping Abilities, they \r\nare combined, and the User gets the Sum of all the Abilities.   \r\n\r\n*Ex.*\r\n\r\n    User \r\n      Role: Commentor\r\n      Abilities: \r\n        Controller: Comments\r\n        Actions: Create, Edit \r\n      Role: Moderator\r\n      Abilities: \r\n        Controller: Comments\r\n        Actions: Delete\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the User will be able to Create, Edit, and Delete on the \r\nComments Controller.\r\n\r\n###ACL Usage\r\n\r\nTo use `authorization` in a controller, you must load the `authorization` \r\ncontroller first:\r\n\r\n    load('authorization');\r\n\r\n...and then use it like:\r\n\r\n    before(use('authorize'));\r\n\r\nYou have 3 choices:\r\n\r\n1. Use `authorization` everywhere\r\n2. Use `authorization` on all actions on a controller\r\n3. Use `authorization` on specific actions in a controller\r\n\r\n*Everywhere*:\r\nIn the `application_controller` add the following line near the top: \r\n    \r\n    before(use('authorize'));\r\n\r\n\r\n*All Controller Actions*:\r\nIn any controller, add the following line near the top**:\r\n\r\n    before(use('authorize'));\r\n\r\n\r\n*Specific Controller Actions*:\r\nIn any controller, add the following line near the top**:\r\n\r\n    before(use('authorize'), only: ['destroy', 'create']);\r\n\r\n**Remember to `load('authorization')` at the top of you controller to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Cached Roles / Abilities\r\n\r\nUse the cache at your own discretion. What it basically means is that if the \r\ncached vars (`cacheRoles`, `cacheAbilities`) are set to `true`, then they will\r\nnot be reloaded when the page is loaded. This is great for performance, but \r\nunless you update the `session.user` object when Roles and Abilities are \r\nadded/removed, the User will keep his or her permissions until the next time \r\nthey log in. This _could_ be a security threat for your app, YMMV.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Install\r\n\r\n1. Clone Repo  \r\n    `git clone [this repo url]`\r\n\r\n2. Install Modules  \r\n    `npm install -l`\r\n\r\n3. Set up confs, see the `config/acomplish/*.json` confs. \r\n\r\n4. Add your (or someone's) email address to the `settings.json` file in the \r\n    _config/acomplish_ directory. Owners override ACL, so any email addresses\r\n    that you put in this array can do anything in the app, regardless of \r\n    authorization.\r\n\r\n5. Create DB (See DB Setup Below)  \r\n    `compound db migrate`\r\n\r\n6. Run Server  \r\n    `node server.js` *OR* `forever server.js`\r\n\r\n\r\nDB Setup (mysql)\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n\tmysql> CREATE DATABASE acomplish;\r\n\tmysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON acomplish.* TO \"dbuser\"@\"localhost\" IDENTIFIED BY \"dbpasswd\";\r\n\tmysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES; \r\n\tmysql> EXIT  \r\n\t  \r\nNote, `redis` is definitely supported, documentation needed here for \r\n    `redis` support.\r\n\r\n##Contribute\r\n\r\nLet me know if you would like to participate, or fork/pull. \r\n\r\n###Thanks\r\n * [Anatoliy Chakkaev](https://github.com/1602), this is built on top of the \r\n CompoundJS Framework\r\n\r\n##License\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Daniel Lochrie\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
