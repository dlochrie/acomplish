It's frustrating, if you know of an elegant solution, let me know.  \r\n\r\nAnother way of handling this is seeing: [http://book.mixu.net/ch7.html](http://book.mixu.net/ch7.html), particularly section\r\n7.2.1 Control flow pattern #1: Series. Mikito Takada has some really insightful documentation on the asynchronous nature of\r\nNode, and how we might solve this problem (or work nicely with this feature :-)).  \r\n\r\n*Update*: See method `getAssociated` the *application_controller* for a useful way or handling associations. Again, if you know of a more elegant solution, let me know.  \r\n##Components\r\n\r\n* [Compound.JS](http://compoundjs.com/) (formally known as Railway) is built on the [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) framework.\r\n* Templates are using [ejs](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs).\r\n* ORM is [Juggling DB](https://github.com/1602/jugglingdb).\r\n* This example is using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) throughout, but not through a plugin.\r\n\r\n##Models\r\n\r\n(Currently):\r\n\r\n* __Posts__: { BelongsTo: [ Users ], HasMany: [ Comments ] }\r\n* __Comments__: { BelongsTo: [ Posts, Users ] }\r\n* __Users__: { HasMany: [ Comments, Posts ], HABTM: [ Roles (through Memberships) ] }\r\n* __Roles__: { HABTM: [ Users (through Memberships) ]}\r\n* __Memberships__: { BelongsTo: [ Posts, Roles ] }\r\n\r\nMaybe more to come, including __Photos__, see [Picsee](https://github.com/dlochrie/picsee).\r\n\r\n##Install\r\n\r\n*TODO:* Add more instructions for how to configure a cloned app. \r\n\r\n1. Clone Repo  \r\n    `git clone [this repo url]`\r\n\r\n2. Install Modules  \r\n    `[sudo] npm install -l`\r\n\r\n3. Create DB (See DB Setup Below)  \r\n    `compound db migrate`\r\n\r\n4. Run Server  \r\n    `node server.js` *OR* `forever server.js`\r\n\r\n\r\nDB Setup (mysql)\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n\tmysql> CREATE DATABASE acomplish;\r\n\tmysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON acomplish.* TO \"dbuser\"@\"localhost\" IDENTIFIED BY \"dbpasswd\";\r\n\tmysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES; \r\n\tmysql> EXIT  \r\n\t  \r\n##Contribute\r\n\r\nLet me know if you would like to participate, or fork/pull. \r\n\r\n###Thanks\r\n * [Anatoliy Chakkaev](https://github.com/1602), this is built on top of the CompoundJS Framework\r\n\r\n##License\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Daniel Lochrie\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
